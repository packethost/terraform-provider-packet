[Please review the Packet to Equinix provider migration guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/equinix/equinix/latest/docs/guides/migration_guide_packet).

The [Equinix provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/equinix/equinix/latest/docs) has full support for existing Terraform managed Metal ([Packet is now Equinix Metal](https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2020/10/06/equinix-metal-metal-and-more/)) resources once Terraform configuration and state are adapted.  The Equinix provider manages resources including Network Edge and Fabric in addition to Metal.
